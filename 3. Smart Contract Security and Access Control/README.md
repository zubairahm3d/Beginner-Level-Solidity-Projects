## Security Best Practices
- **Reentrancy Protection**: Always use checks-effects-interactions pattern
- **Input Validation**: Validate all external inputs with `require()`
- **Access Control**: Follow principle of least privilege
- **Library Usage**: Prefer audited libraries (OpenZeppelin) for common patterns
- **Gas Limits**: Be mindful of loops and unbounded operations
- **Upgrade Patterns**: Consider proxy patterns for mutable logic
