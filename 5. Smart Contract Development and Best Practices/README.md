## Best Practices

### Security Patterns
- Use OpenZeppelin's Pausable for production contracts
- Implement checks-effects-interactions pattern
- Always verify external calls
- Use reentrancy guards for state-changing functions

### Gas Optimization
- Prefer mappings over arrays for large datasets
- Pack related variables into single storage slots
- Use immutable for deployment-time constants
- Consider using bytes32 instead of string where possible

### Code Organization
- Separate logic into parent/child contracts
- Use interfaces for cross-contract communication
- Group related functions together
- Document complex logic with NatSpec comments

## Development Workflow Tips
1. **Testing**: Write comprehensive unit tests for all state changes
2. **Versioning**: Use semantic versioning for contract upgrades
3. **Documentation**: Maintain updated NatSpec for all public functions
4. **Auditing**: Consider formal verification for critical contracts
5. **Monitoring**: Implement event logging for important state changes
6. **Upgradeability**: Design with upgrade patterns in mind
7. **Gas Profiling**: Test with different input sizes to identify bottlenecks
